Virtual camera to use a mobile phone as a webcam. You need to install the IP Webcam app on your phone and "start server" (last option, at the very bottom).

Don't work with guvcview, but *works in Tahoma2D.*

First, download and install this app on your phone:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=es&pli=1

Then, launch the app and tap on “Start server” (at the bottom).

After that, open my program and enter your phone’s IP address.

It will load two modules (click accept), and finally it will notify you that the camera is connected (on your phone you'll also see “video connections: 1”).
